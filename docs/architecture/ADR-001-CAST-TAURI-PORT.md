# ADR-001 — Lalin Cast Rust + Tauri v2 Port

## Decision status

**APPROVED FOR LOCAL TAURI P0 IMPLEMENTATION AND DIAL COMPATIBILITY SLICE.** ผู้ใช้สั่งเดินหน้าหลังจาก
review ความเป็นไปได้ของการ port VacuumTube มาเป็น Rust + Tauri v2 วันที่
2026-09-19 การอนุมัตินี้ครอบคลุมเฉพาะ candidate shell, remote WebView,
User-Agent compatibility, single-instance, settings boundary และ local DIAL
discovery/bridge; numeric TV-code pairing is now user-confirmed in the current
debug runtime, but this is still not production, packaged-app or clean-VM
acceptance

Complexity: **C-3**. Risk: **HIGH** (WebView2 compatibility, upstream endpoint,
network filtering, account state และ device discovery).

## Context

- `reference/vacuumtube` มี VacuumTube v1.8.2 fork สำหรับเป็น Electron fallback
  และมี provenance/launch contract อยู่แล้ว
- VacuumTube เป็น Electron wrapper ของ official YouTube Leanback surface ไม่ใช่
  custom YouTube client
- ผู้ใช้ต้องการสกัด feature หลักมาใช้กับ Rust + Tauri v2 เพื่อลด Electron shell
  และรักษาขอบเขต Lalin Cast เป็นแอปแยกจาก Studio
- Tauri v2 รองรับ remote WebView URL, per-window User-Agent, initialization
  script, native plugins, tray และ Rust commands/events; ความสามารถเหล่านี้ยัง
  ต้องพิสูจน์กับ YouTube Leanback บน Windows WebView2 จริง

## Decision

สร้าง `src-tauri` เป็น Tauri v2 runtime ของ Lalin Cast แยกจากทั้ง Lalin Studio และ
Electron fallback โดยให้ Rust เป็น owner ของ native shell และให้ WebView โหลด
official Leanback surface โดยตรง

    STUDIO[Lalin Studio\nLalin-AI repository] -->|installed artifact| TAURI[Lalin Cast\nsrc-tauri / Rust + Tauri v2]

    TAURI --> WEBVIEW[WebView2\nLeanback surface]
    ELECTRON --> WEBVIEW2[Electron Chromium\nLeanback surface]
    TAURI --> CORE[Rust shell\nsettings/tray/lifecycle]
```

The Electron fork remains the behavior reference and rollback path. No current
Play owner is replaced by this candidate.

## Feature extraction matrix

| VacuumTube capability | Tauri target | Local slice | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Electron window/lifecycle | Rust `WebviewWindowBuilder` and Tauri run loop | port now | `cargo check` + Windows GUI smoke |
| Leanback URL | remote WebView2 URL | port now | endpoint loads and actual URL is recorded |
| Leanback User-Agent | Tauri WebView User-Agent | port now | compare request/navigation behavior with Electron |
| fullscreen, focus, close, single instance | Tauri window API + single-instance plugin | port now | reopen/focus/close lifecycle |
| settings persistence | Tauri store boundary | port now as best-effort shell preference seed | load/save without credentials; unavailable store must not block launch |
| controller/touch DOM behavior | initialization script / later JS adapter | deferred | real controller and touch evidence |
| SponsorBlock/DeArrow/Return Dislikes | JS adapter after CSP/runtime review | deferred | feature-by-feature parity |
| upstream ad-block controls | separate compatibility gate | deferred | setting behavior in real WebView |
| Electron request/response interception | Rust/native WebView2 adapter | not in P0 | WebView2 API proof and security review |
| DIAL discovery | supervised Rust SSDP + bounded HTTP Rust boundary | local slice implemented with retry/rebind | port/descriptor, listener recovery and same-Wi-Fi device evidence |
| H5VCC DIAL bridge | narrow initialization script + `dial_respond` command | local slice implemented with continuous device-id sync | route callback and real controller/device evidence |
| numeric TV-code pairing | not assumed | user-confirmed for current debug runtime | repeat/relink and packaged-app evidence |

## Endpoint and identity boundary

The P0 default is the endpoint documented by the pinned upstream:
`https://www.youtube.com/tv`. `tv.youtube.com` is not silently substituted for
that path; it remains a separate verification target. The User-Agent compatibility
string is derived from the pinned VacuumTube source and is marked in provenance.
This is compatibility behavior for the official surface, not a claim that Lalin
is an official YouTube TV application.

## Ad-filter boundary

P0 does not add a custom YouTube-specific network bypass, DRM change, credential
relay or playback rewrite. The Tauri port may later expose a general filter
engine or retain a verified upstream setting only after a separate compatibility
and security review. A filter result must be reported as observed behavior, not
as a promise that every future ad format is blocked.

## Security and ownership rules

- The remote YouTube WebView receives no broad Lalin filesystem, shell or process
  permission.
- The remote capability is limited to the official `www.youtube.com` origin and
  the DIAL response/event contract; no filesystem, shell, process or arbitrary
  network command is exposed.
- The Rust DIAL HTTP parser caps headers at 16 KiB and bodies at 100 KiB; only
  `/`, `/apps` and `/apps/*` are handled.
- No cookies, account tokens, pairing codes or session data are committed or
  logged.
- Electron remains the fallback until Tauri endpoint, sign-in, playback,
  controller, fullscreen and lifecycle parity is evidenced.

## P0 acceptance criteria

1. `src-tauri` has a reproducible Tauri v2/Rust project and pinned
   configuration.
2. Rust builds the native shell with the Leanback URL and upstream-derived
   User-Agent configuration.
3. Single-instance focus and best-effort settings persistence have explicit
   boundaries; an unavailable local store does not block the media window.
4. Static checks pass; any GUI failure is recorded as host/runtime evidence and
   is not converted into a false success.
5. Electron fork and current Play remain untouched as rollback paths.

## Local implementation record

- `src-tauri` now contains the standalone Rust + Tauri v2 Cast runtime.
- The native shell builds a remote WebView for the pinned Leanback endpoint,
  applies the upstream-derived User-Agent, seeds a local settings store and
  ports fullscreen/keep-on-top/reload/quit native menu actions.
- Runtime RCA confirmed that a restricted host can deny the local settings
  store. Settings now fall back to safe defaults so persistence failure does
  not prevent the shell from starting; persistence itself remains unverified in
  the GUI gate.
- The approved DIAL slice now binds the LAN interface on UDP 1900 with
  `SO_REUSEADDR`, serves a DIAL XML descriptor on an ephemeral local HTTP port,
  persists a non-secret device identity, and exposes only the upstream-shaped
  `window.h5vcc.dial.DialServer` route surface. A supervisor retries startup,
  rebinds after listener errors or LAN IPv4 changes, and continuously syncs the
  official Leanback device id.
- Static evidence: `cargo fmt --check`, offline `cargo check` and
  `cargo test` (2 DIAL tests) and `tauri build --debug --no-bundle --ci`
  **PASS**. Runtime process evidence shows UDP 1900 and an HTTP `GET /` 200
  descriptor with `Application-URL`.
- The initial host SSDP probe did not receive a response. The active Ethernet
  profile was then changed from `Public` to `Private` to match the scoped
  firewall rules; after relaunch, the user confirmed same-Wi-Fi iPhone
  connection through the numeric TV-code flow.
- Packaged/clean-VM repeatability, endpoint/account/controller parity and
  ad-filter behavior remain **NOT_RUN/PARTIAL**; the local pairing result is
  not a production-readiness claim.
- Physical network-drop/reconnect recovery remains a separate runtime gate;
  the rebuilt local runtime has not yet been accepted as clean-VM or production
  ready.

## Rejected shortcuts

| Shortcut | Reason |
|---|---|
| Delete Electron before Tauri parity | removes the only existing behavior reference |
| Clone Leanback UI locally | loses official surface behavior and increases drift |
| Give remote YouTube page shell/process permissions | violates least privilege |
| Claim TV-code pairing from DIAL discovery | different capabilities and evidence |
| Implement custom ad bypass in P0 | high compatibility/security risk and unapproved scope |
